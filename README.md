I was sorta bored and i wanted to learn python so  this is a program that pulls playlist data off of the Spotify API and searches and downloads the automatically in soulseek

-------- Plz add more details here if you work on it and updated any funtionality-------------

So far all i have is a python script that runs in powershell, it takes playlist information afrom the spotify api and pritns the contents of that playlist in the terminal as well as in a new 
txt file.
